I recommend you complete the previous version of this kata before trying this one.

After slacking off at your last job as a security guard you were fired and decided to get a position as a janitor at NASA.
Your job is to clean the messes made by people that bump into each other and drop items.
You decide to use the skills you gained in your last job (the same skills that got you fired lol),
but this time instead of playing around you want to use them to make your job easier by figuring out if you need to
go to a room ahead of time and which rooms to prioritize first.

You will be given a room within the facility (matrix of chars) with people walking up, right, down, and left
all labeled u, r, d, and l respectively, all taking steps at the same time in their respective directions.
Your task is to return the minimum amount of steps it will take until someone collides or if nobody collides return -1.

A step represents a person moving one - in their respective direction, each person moves 1 step at a time

People can walk off the grid, they will not loop around

Here are some examples of rooms and minimum steps

Return 1, because d and l collide after 1 step
-r--l         --rl-
-----         -u---
-u-d-         -----
----l         ---X-
----- becomes -----
Return -1, because nobody will collide
-u---         ---uu         -----         -----
---uu         -----         -----         -----
---r-         ----r         -----         -----
--r--         ---r-         ----r         -----
-d--- becomes ----- becomes ----- becomes ----- Thus nobody collided
If people pass each other on the same row/column (A person moving up passing a person moving down in the same column or
a person moving right passing a person moving left in the same row), that is treated as a collision.

They collided after 2 steps here
--r--l-- -> ---rl--- -> ---lr---
This counts as a collision after 1 step as well
--          ---
-d-         -u-
-u-         -d-
--- becomes ---
However in cases like these there are no collisions
----          -u-- |  ----         ----
-ur-          ---r |  -dl-         -lu-
-ld-          l--- |  -ru-         -dr-
---- becomes  --d- |  ---- becomes ----
